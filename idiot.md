**The Idiot**  

_by Carmine Giordano_  

He slipped into their railroad car  
while they were nodding,  
the wild-eyed idiot of the suburban line,  
and rattled the suited gentlemen  
and the tailored ladies thus  
with his shouting:  

"Citizens of the mad world,  
you who kill each other's children  
throwing then down from the sky in planes  
and drowning their dolls,  
you who rip off their clutching hands  
as they look up at you  
through the bombing glass of buses,  
cars and taxicabs,  

Give up your Jesus, Allah and Adonai;  
give up your presidents and prophets;  
give up your assemblies full of national love;  
give up your multicolored flags;  
give up your marching songs;  
give up your history books;  
give up the deeds and contracts to your lands;  
dismantle all your shrines;  
erase the names of your martyred saints;  
give up your separate tongues;  
give up the bitch who kills us all,  
your mother-god who favors only you and yours.  

Stand with me in the fields,  
in the rain and in the sun,  
our bodies naked in the grass.  
Link arms with me,  
and start again.  
We will create all things new!  

I have been selected from the nations  
to tell you this."  

At 9:05 at the Greenwich Station  
the platform guards removed him  
while the gentlemen coughed  
and the ladies refreshed their faces.
