**Images of an Impending War**  

The white dead dove  
Defeated by hatred and fear  
Its eyes towards the sky  
Sinks in a sea of innocent blood  
Overflowing with disappointment and hope.  

Rivers of blood  
Deserts of solitude  
Oceans of tears  
Eyes lost towards a horizon  
Where love and peace are only dreams  
Hatred and war a sad reality.  

People running with frightened faces, with stony eyes  
Souls reflecting the hope of reaching the last buoy  
In a sad reality, too near,  
Full of fear, indifference and expressions that are not friendly.  

Cries of desperate children  
In the silence of our indifference  
Ask for love and receive bombs  
Victims of the selfishness of the powerful  
Who have planned their future.  

Who will dare  
Stare the orphan in the eyes  
Who will dare  
Explain to a family they have lost everything  
Who will dare  
Tell them that this is right  
For a better future  
When they do not have a present.  

Minds remember  
Eyes cry  
Bodies die  
Dreams fade  
Fears destroy hearts.
